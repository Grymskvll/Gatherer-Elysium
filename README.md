# Gatherer-Elysium
A 100% accurate and complete* Gatherer file for Elysium vanilla WoW realms.

**WARNING
**This file does NOT go in the Interface\Addons folder.

###*This Gatherer database should include the following:
-All herbs
-All ore nodes
-All fishing nodes
-All Felwood corrupted plants
-All solid chests
-All Blood of Heroes


###Installation:
1. Delete (or backup) the following files if they are present:
```
WoW\WTF\Account\YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME\SavedVariables\Gatherer.lua
WoW\WTF\Account\YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME\SavedVariables\Gatherer.lua.bak
```

2. Place Gatherer.lua in the following directory:
```
WoW\WTF\Account\YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME\SavedVariables\
```

3. Enter the game and configure Gatherer's filters. Because of the enormous amount of nodes, Gatherer might cause an interface error if you don't filter some node types.
